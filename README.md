# 👋 Hi, I’m Gayathree Gopi

🎓 I’m a business analytics professional and MSBA candidate at UT Austin, with a background in computational biology and growing experience in real estate analytics, investor modeling, and strategic problem solving.

💼 I use Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel to turn complex data into insight — whether that's building market prioritization tools, developing investor dashboards, or forecasting with sentiment signals.

🔍 I’m especially interested in:
- Real estate & financial analytics  
- Forecasting & investment strategy  
- Geospatial modeling & site selection  
- Data-informed decision making in consulting contexts

⚡ Fun fact: I also run an art brand called *Chitralekha Creations*, where I blend storytelling and visual design with Indian spiritual art.
